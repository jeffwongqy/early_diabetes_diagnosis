                     In the past three decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent

                     to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025.
